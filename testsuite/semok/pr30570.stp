# the try block is elided
probe oneshot {
    try { }
    catch (e1)
    { print(e1) }
}

# error var is elided
probe oneshot {
    try { print("foo") }
    catch (e2)
    { }
}

# error var and the try block are elided
probe oneshot {
    try { }
    catch (e3)
    { }
}

# error var and the try block are elided which means
# it's not an issue to use e4 as a long here
global e4 = 10
probe oneshot {
    try { }
    catch (e4)

# e5 can be a global string
