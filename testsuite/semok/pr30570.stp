# PR30570: ei should be resolvable in all of the following

# the try block is elided
probe oneshot {
    try { }
    catch (e1)
    { print(e1) }
}

# error var is elided
probe oneshot {
    try { print("foo") }

}

# error var and the try block are elided
probe oneshot {
    try { }
    catch (e3)
    { }
}

# error var and the try block are elided which means
# it's not an issue to use e4 as a long here ...
# except after PR32964, type checking is done more
# systematically on even elided variables, so this 
# would be an error!
# global e4 = 10
# probe oneshot {
#     try { }
#     catch (e4)
#     { }
# }

# e5 can be a global string
global e5 = "foo"
